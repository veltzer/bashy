# errexit_save_and_start e

# errexit_restore "${e}"

# command substitution runs in a subshell, so a "set -e" performed inside one
# would be thrown away instead of reaching the caller.

# Remember whether errexit is currently on, then turn it on.
# Echoes the previous state ("on"/"off") when no out_var is given.
