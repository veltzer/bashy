- make sure that we have no "evals" left in the code.
- allow plugins to depend on our plugins and deduce right order and plugins
	to activate automatically.
- add an option for plugins to report what type of error made them not run.
	This could be done with another variable passed to the plugin function
	whose value is the reason for the error in case the plugin returns "1".
	This value could be shown when doing "bashy_status_plugins".
- clean our path (remove duplicate entries) in bashy.
- put all the extra paths we have at the end of the path and not in the beginging.
	(actauly have a config for that).
- make a script that installs bashy locally without the .git
	folder.
- make a script run_tests.bash
	that runs all tests and makes sure that everything is fine.
- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
	this is a work in progress, look at core/misc.sh.
- make bashy be reloadable (currently it is not as the array just keep growing).
- make every bashy plugin have turn on and turn off so that we could turn them
	on and off.
	do commands for that.
- make bashy have uninstall for each plugin and install.
- if a plugin needs a configuration option let him declare that and documentation for it.
	Let it read it from the ~/.bashy.config file (the file already exists)
- separate myenv from bashy.
- stop calling all the functions bashy_* and configure_* install_* these pollute the users
	namespace. Put _bashy in front of any function that is internal to bashy.
	bashy_+[TAB] should only show functions that users may want to run.
