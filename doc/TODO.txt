- the snipplet/main.md.mako does not show on the main
	page. make it not so.
- pimp up my powerline-shell
	add powerline line feel to tmux.
- create more check functions in core/check.bash and use them all over my plugins.
- create distributions on github as a result of bashy workflow with proper versioning
	and change the instructions about using bashy to get bashy from last version.
- make sure that we have no "evals" left in the code.
- allow plugins to depend on other plugins and deduce right order and plugins
	to activate automatically.
- consider using libraries from https://github.com/juan131/bash-libraries
- consider using https://gitlab.com/bertrand-benoit/scripts-common
- clean our path (remove duplicate entries) in bashy.
- put all the extra paths we have at the end of the path and not in the beginging.
	(actauly have a config for that).
- make a script that installs bashy locally without the .git
	folder.
- make a script run_tests.bash
	that runs all tests and makes sure that everything is fine.
- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
	this is a work in progress, look at core/misc.sh.
- make bashy be reloadable (currently it is not as the array just keep growing).
- make every bashy plugin have turn on and turn off so that we could turn them
	on and off.
	do commands for that.
- make bashy have uninstall for each plugin and install.
- if a plugin needs a configuration option let him declare that and documentation for it.
	Let it read it from the ~/.bashy.config file (the file already exists)
- separate myenv from bashy.
- stop calling all the functions bashy_* and configure_* install_* these pollute the users
	namespace. Put _bashy in front of any function that is internal to bashy.
	bashy_+[TAB] should only show functions that users may want to run.
