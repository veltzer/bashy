- make the basic code use more "local -n" and less eval.
- add an option for plugins to report what type of error made them not run.
	This could be done with another variable passed to the plugin function
	whose value is the reason for the error in case the plugin returns "1".
	This value could be shown when doing "bashy_status_plugins".
- clean our path (remove duplicate entries) in bashy.
- put all the extra paths we have at the end of the path and not in the beginging.
	(actauly have a config for that).
- make a script that installs bashy locally without the .git
	folder.
- make a script run_tests.bash
	that runs all tests and makes sure that everything is fine.
- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
	this is a work in progress, look at core/misc.sh.
- bashy should allow the main config file (~/.bashy/external/bashy.list)
	to add plugins to whatever there is in the default
	bashy configuration and to remove plugins.
	maybe:
	+ [name]
	- [name]
- make bashy be reloadable (currently it is not as the array just keep growing).
- make every bashy plugin have turn on and turn off so that we could turn them
	on and off.
	do commands for that.
- make bash have uninstall for each plugin and install.
- separate myenv from bashy.
- stop calling all the functions bashy_* and configure_* install_* these pollute the users
	namespace. Put _bashy in front of any function that is internal to bashy.
	bashy_+[TAB] should only show functions that users may want to run.
- there are plugins which should be run after other plugins.
	enable plugins to express that dependency and load the plugins in the right
	order.
