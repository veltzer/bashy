- measurements do not work, bring them back.
- myenv to work auto well.

- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
	this is a work in progress, look at core/misc.sh.
- bashy should allow the main config file (~/.bashy/external/bashy.list)
	to add plugins to whatever there is in the default
	bashy configuration and to remove plugins.
	maybe:
	+ [name]
	- [name]
- make bashy be reloadable (currently it is not as the array just keep growing).
- make every bashy plugin have turn on and turn off so that we could turn them
	on and off.
	do commands for that.
- make bash have uninstall for each plugin and install.
- separate myenv from bashy.
- stop calling all the functions bashy_* and configure_* install_* these pollute the users
	namespace. Put _bashy in front of any function that is internal to bashy.
	bashy_+[TAB] should only show functions that users may want to run.

TODO list for myenv
===================
- make sure not to create the environment concurrently (this happens if you
have two terminals on the same myenv project and the requirements.txt file
changed for example).
