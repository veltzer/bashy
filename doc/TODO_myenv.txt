- myenv does not work well when the basic config file (~/.myenv)
	does not exist. Make it not so.
- myenv should not turn off virtual envs that I light up myself.
- in the function 'myenv_create' make sure that there are no errors,
	but DO NOT TERMINATE THE SHELL IF THERE ARE. (no -e)
	log the whole creating of the virtual env into a log file
	and let the user know that there was an error in the virtual
	env creation process and show or point him to the log file where
	he could investigate the error.
- make sure not to create the environment concurrently (this happens if you
have two terminals on the same myenv project and the requirements.txt file
changed for example).
- unify myenv and gcloud.
	allow to have more than one virtual env per folder and to select between them.
		this is good for both 2.7 and 3.5 testing for instance.
	add a feature to myenv that enables it to install not just the packages in requirements
		but a full list of files.
	allow myenv to specify the full path to the python interpreter from which to create
		the virtual env and not only the version.
		This gives more flexibility.
	allow to control git identity with myenv.
	allow to control aws account with myenv.
	allow to control default mysql and postgres database with myenv.
	allow to remove the ssh ugliness of the wrong url when doing
		checkout.
- add ability for myenv to run a one time bash script when entering a directory.
- add ability for myenv to source a script when entering a directory and a different one
	when exiting a directory.
- add ability for myenv to have a different list of requirements files per virtual
	env. This is good for 2.7 vs 3.5 lists of requirements.
