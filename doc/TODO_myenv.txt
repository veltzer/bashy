- derive the python version correctly from the python interpreter.
- make sure not to create the environment concurrently (this happens if you
have two terminals on the same myenv project and the requirements.txt file
changed for example).
- unify myenv and gcloud.
	allow to have more than one virtual env per folder and to select between them.
		this is good for both 2.7 and 3.5 testing for instance.
	add a feature to myenv that enables it to install not just the packages in requirements
		but a full list of files.
	allow myenv to specify the full path to the python interpreter from which to create
		the virtual env and not only the version.
		This gives more flexibility.
	allow to control git identity with myenv.
	allow to control aws account with myenv.
	allow to control default mysql and postgres database with myenv.
	allow to remove the ssh ugliness of the wrong url when doing
		checkout.
