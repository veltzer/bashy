- add an option for plugins to report what type of error made them not run.
	This could be done with another variable passed to the plugin function
	whose value is the reason for the error in case the plugin returns "1".
	This value could be shown when doing "bashy_status_plugins".
- add debug capabilities that will print which plugin is loaded.
- check that when I switch to root I can see it on the powerline-shell
	no need for this since when I switch to root I can plainly see
	it since root does not have powerline.
- add icons of python and git.
	submit pull request to powerline-shell authors.
- changed nomenclature:
	configure -> activate
	deactivate where appropriate
- an idea for a bashy plugin:
	you put a .env file in a folder and whenever you enter that folder bashy sets
	environment variables
	according to what is written in the file.
	When you exit the folder the variables are unset.
	This could be used, for instance, to configure tools like pip using environment variables.
- you can no longer register that same functin twice.
- add a bashy command "bashy_off" which turns all of bashy off and does undo for everything.
	and bashy_on to turn it back on.
