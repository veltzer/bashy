# This runs tmux at the start of a session.
#
# This plugin executes tmux which means it turned
# the current process into tmux.
# when tmux will run a shell again and will run bashy
# again we will know that we are in tmux already
# and will not run it again.
#
# This does not mean that this plugin should be run
# last. On the contrary. It should be run first to enable
# tmux to run bash which will run all plugins. Since
# the old bash turned into tmux (that's exec for you)
# then we don't need to old shell and any of the plugins
# that came before this one are wasted. That is why this
# should be the first plugin to run.
#
# currently this code follows the following flow:
# if a session already exists, attach to it
# if not - start a new session.
#
# the new algorithm
# check if there are any detached sessions to tmux
# if there are, offer a dialog to attach to them.
# if there are not, just start a new session.
