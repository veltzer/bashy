- bashy should not print anything during loading of plugins but rather just
	gather the debug info.
- a later command bashy info would print all this info.
- bashy should include all of its components by including everything
	under $BASHY/core
	and not one by one.
- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
- bashy should read which plugins to include using config file. First
	~/.bashy.list
	and then $BASHY/bashy.list
	The first is where a user should put his config to override what bashy author
	thinks is the best configuration.
	If a user does not wish to override what the bashy author think is the best
	configuration then he should just not create such a file in which case
	bashy will activate the default that comes with it and gets updated with it.
