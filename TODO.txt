- bashy should collect which sources of which plugins went bad
	and print that info in bashy_status.
- bashy should not pollute the users bash namespace with too many functions.
	this is a work in progress, look at core/misc.sh.
- bashy should allow the main config file (~/.bashy/external/bashy.list)
	to add plugins to whatever there is in the default
	bashy configuration and to remove plugins.
	maybe:
	+ [name]
	- [name]
