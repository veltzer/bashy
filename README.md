Bashy is bash based system to enable you control of your bash with precision and elegance.
It is plugin based and allows for easy extension.

## Installing Bashy

First clone the repository into your home directory:

```bash
git clone --branch master --depth 1 https://github.com/veltzer/bashy.git ~/.bashy && rm -rf ~/.bashy/.git
```

Then edit `~/.bashrc` and add the following line as the last line:

```bash
source ~/.bashy/bashy.sh
```

In my own setup this is the only line I have in my `~/.bashrc`

### Installing from a working copy

If you develop bashy rather than just use it, clone the repository somewhere else
and install from there:

```bash
./scripts/install_in_home.bash
```

That copies only what is needed at runtime, listed in `.includes`, and it is
incremental: it prints the files that changed and copies nothing else. `--delete`
prunes anything in `~/.bashy` that is no longer part of the install, so a renamed or
removed plugin does not linger.

To check whether the running `~/.bashy` still matches your checkout:

```bash
bashy_check_deployment
```


## Debugging Bashy

Just add this line before sourcing bashy:
```bash
set -o xtrace
```

To see all errors use:
```bash
bashy_errors
```

To get debug messages you can create a `~/.bashy.config` and put the following content into it:

```
readonly BASHY_DEBUG=0
```

## Working with Bashy

To check the status of the core of Bashy use:

```bash
bashy_status_core
```

To check the status of plugins of Bashy use:

```bash
bashy_status_plugins
```

To disable or enable a plugins or to change the order in which
they are applied just edit `~/.bashy.list`

```
# this file supports hash comments
by_host
meta
path_mine
-path_pycharm_add
pylogconf
```

To reread the plugins use:

```bash
bashy_load_plugins
```

To reinit Bashy when a new version is installed or pulled:

```bash
bashy_init
```

## Writing Bashy plugins

Bashy plugins may never fail a command (all commands need to return 0)

Bashy plugins need to set a variable passed by reference to either 0 or 1.

Here is the most basic plugin:

```bash
function _activate_hello_plugin() {
	local -n __var=$1
	# this means everything was ok
	__var=0
}
register _activate_hello_plugin
```

### Writing a prompt plugin

A prompt plugin registers a function that runs after every command you type, not
once at startup. Register it from your activation function:


```bash
function prompt_hello() {
	# runs on every prompt
	:
}

function _activate_prompt_hello() {
	local -n __var=$1
	local -n __error=$2
	_bashy_prompt_register prompt_hello
	__var=0
}
register_interactive _activate_prompt_hello
```


Because it runs that often, speed is the whole design constraint. A prompt function
that forks once costs a few milliseconds every single command, and there are nine
prompt plugins here, so it adds up quickly. Do not run a program if a shell builtin
or an already exported variable will do.

If you need to know whether the current directory is inside a git repository, call
`git_is_inside` rather than running `git` yourself. It remembers the answer per
directory, which took about 28 ms off every prompt when the seven plugins that ask
were each forking their own `git rev-parse`. Call `git_is_inside_flush` if a
repository appears or disappears under a directory you are already in.

Registration prepends, so prompt functions run in reverse registration order: a
plugin listed later in `bashy.list` gets to set `PS1` before an earlier one.

### Shell completions

Do not run a completion command directly at activation time. Every one of those is
a process spawn on every shell you open, and they added up to about a second here.
Use `bashy_completion` instead, which runs the command once and caches the result:

```bash
# instead of: source <(minikube completion bash)
bashy_completion minikube minikube completion bash
```

The first argument is the tool whose binary keys the cache, the rest is the command
to run. The cache lives under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/bashy/completions` and is
keyed on the size and mtime of the tool, so upgrading the tool regenerates it by
itself. `bashy_completion_clean` drops the cache.

This is for completion output only. `zoxide init`, `starship init` and friends emit
shell setup that may embed per session state, so those keep running live.

### Writing an installer

Install functions are named `_install_<name>` and should never hardcode a version
number: always ask the project what its latest release is. The core modules provide
the pieces so that every plugin behaves and reports the same way.


```bash
function _install_hello() {
	local release_json
	bashy_github_release "someorg/hello" release_json || return
	latest_version=$(bashy_github_version "${release_json}")
	folder="${HOME}/install/binaries"
	executable="${folder}/hello"
	# an empty installed version means "not installed yet"
	installed_version=""
	if [ -x "${executable}" ]
	then
		installed_version=$("${executable}" --version 2>/dev/null)
	fi
	# prints one of the three standard lines and says whether there is work to do
	if bashy_install_check "hello" "${installed_version}" "${latest_version}"
	then
		return
	fi
	local download_file
	bashy_github_asset "${release_json}" "_linux_amd64\\.tar\\.gz$" download_file || return
	bashy_install_download "${download_file}"
	local tar
	bashy_download "${download_file}" tar || return
	# verify whenever the project publishes checksums
	local checksums
	bashy_github_asset "${release_json}" "checksums\\.txt$" checksums || return
	bashy_verify_sha256 "${tar}" "${checksums}" || return
	rm -f "${executable}"
	bashy_install_extract "${tar}" "${folder}" hello
}

function _uninstall_hello() {
	bashy_uninstall_binary "hello"
}
```


The helpers involved:

| function | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bashy_install_check <name> <installed> <latest>` | print the standard install/upgrade/up to date line, return 0 when there is nothing to do |
| `bashy_install_download <url>` | report the artifact about to be fetched |
| `bashy_github_release <owner/repo> [out]` | fetch the latest release json |
| `bashy_github_version <json> [prefix]` | tag name with the prefix (default `v`) stripped |
| `bashy_github_asset <json> <regex> [out]` | the single asset url matching a regex, fails on an ambiguous match |
| `bashy_download <url> [out]` | download through the cache, revalidating against the origin |
| `bashy_verify_sha256 <file> <url or digest>` | check a download against a published sha256 |
| `bashy_install_extract <archive> <folder> [members...]` | unpack and stamp with the install time rather than the archive mtime |
| `bashy_uninstall_binary <name> [path]` | remove a single binary from `~/install/binaries` |
| `bashy_uninstall_directory <name> <dir...>` | remove the directory tree(s) a plugin installed |

Downloads are cached under `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/bashy/downloads`, overridable
with `BASHY_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`. Cached files are revalidated with the origin, so a
rolling `latest` asset that keeps one filename forever is still refetched when it
changes upstream. Use `bashy_download_clean` to drop the cache.

Never pipe a remote script into a shell when the project ships a release asset that
can be downloaded and verified instead.

## Core module load order

The modules in `core` are loaded in the order listed by `bashy_core_order` in
`bashy.sh`, not alphabetically. The list runs from the standalone modules to the
ones built on top of them, so a module may call into anything loaded before it and
does not have to source its own dependencies.

When adding a core module, put its name in that list at a point where everything it
uses is already loaded. A module left out of the list is still loaded, after all the
named ones.

## Profiling startup

Plugin activation is not timed unless you ask for it. To see where shell startup
time goes, put this in `~/.bashy.config`:

```bash
readonly BASHY_PROFILE=0
```

then open a shell and run `bashy_status_plugins`.


## Config files

You can activate various plgins via the `~/.bashy.config` file.

Here is an example:

```bash
readonly ENCFS_ENABLED=true
readonly ENCFS_FOLDER_CLEAR="${HOME}/insync.real"
readonly ENCFS_FOLDER_ENCRYPTED="${HOME}/insync/encrypted"
readonly ENCFS_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXX
readonly PROXY_ENABLED=false
```


This is a bash file and so you can overwrite values by using conditionals so:
```bash
if [ "$HOSTNAME" = "ion" ]
then
	readonly PROXY_ENABLED=true
	readonly PROXY_HTTP="http://proxy.corp.com:8080"
	readonly PROXY_HTTPS="http://proxy.corp.com:8080"
	readonly PROXY_NO="localhost,.corp.com"
fi
```
